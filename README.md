## Headcount

Headcount is an application that parses CSVs to create a relational database of information from Data.gov for public school data using only Ruby. There is a data access layer, an analysis layer, and a relationships layer to the application. The data access layer allows the database to be queried for specific data for a district or all districts in the state of Colorado. The analysis layer returns statistical analysis about the data, for example: highest performing district(s) for statewide testing (for selected grades & subjects or all grades and subjects), an economic profile for a district, and answers the question 'does kindergarten participation rate correlate with high school graduation?'
